After that, make a directory, for the plugin.  
After that, the plugin should do all the work for the most part, launch the plugin, hopefully it explains you need an Webhook attached (Webhook is to log the chats), you can do this by going to the config file and then find "webhook": "INSERT-WEBHOOK" . Place webhook in there. 

The .json files currently do nothing, It's recommeneded to disable whitelist.

# WHITELIST

Follow same placement as Chat Logger,
Use command /whitelist for easy time
Use command /whitelist in console for less easy time xD

# WEBHOOK DISCORD CHAT LOG

Please input the chat_logs.txt in the correct location for the directory you have chosen.
